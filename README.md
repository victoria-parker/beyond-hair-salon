# Beyond Hair Salon
This is a website I built inspired for a hair salon. It is a one page website, fully responsive that has all the sections it needs to present the salon.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this project with the objective of building a simple website for a small client with the idea of keeping the code as clean as possible.

## Optimizations
Need to work on the menu as I didn't have the chance yet.
